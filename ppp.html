          <p>As the president of Human7, a humanitarian association at Enseeiht, I have been heavily engaged in various tasks and initiatives to support the organization's goals and objectives.

            One of my main responsibilities has been managing the financial aspects of the organization, including serving as treasurer and seeking out sponsors and donations. I have also played a key role in organizing events, such as a tombola and a pink race in Toulouse, which have helped to raise funds for our humanitarian efforts.
            
            One of the biggest challenges I have faced as president has been coordinating and supporting the humanitarian trips organized by our school. This has involved helping students find appropriate partnerships and funding for their projects, as well as providing guidance and support throughout the planning process.
            
            One of the highlights of my engagement with Human7 has been the establishment of a partnership with Vinci, which has provided a significant source of funding for our humanitarian efforts. This partnership has allowed us to make a greater impact and to support a wider range of projects.
            
            Overall, my engagement with Human7 has been a challenging but rewarding experience. I am proud to have played a key role in supporting the organization's efforts to make a positive difference in the world, and I look forward to continuing to contribute to its success in the future. So, being the president of this association is a huge responsability but it's a very good experience too.
