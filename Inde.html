          </div>
          <p>With 4 other students of the enseeiht, we chose to do our first year internship in India to realize a humanitarian mission. We left for 6 weeks in a village in Tamil Nadu near Nagapattinam. We took 1 week to travel from Chennai to the village: we were alone, with our backpack in front of this great country. The shock was great for us, because the culture and the way of life is extreme.
            The solution, the dirt and the poverty made us realize how lucky we are to live in France. The beginning was complicated for us because we had no referent of the association with us. We arrived in the small village and we stayed 4 weeks, we lived with the inhabitant (in rather complicated conditions). We helped a school to build toilets, we gave lessons and rehabilitated the sports field. We also gave classes on the environment to encourage the children to keep their school clean and to use the garbage cans.
            We made a connection with these school children but also with the family in which we lived. We were able to live incredible moments: riding a scooter in India, going to a wedding, living completely with the Indian way of life,... This trip allowed us to acquire a great open-mindedness which is useful for us personnal and professional life. </p>
